- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ray Loerke (@rloerke)

I am interested in understanding the world, both in terms of its logical systems and abstract nature. Computer science allows me to creatively problem solve in a well-defined space, and hopefully find solutions that can make the world a better place. The satisfaction of solving a difficult problem or mastering a complex system drives me to learn more. I am currently pursuing a double major in computer science and philosophy. 

Philosophy allows me to break out of the structured, solution-seeking mindset of purely logical thinking. I love to explore the edges of human understanding and question the systems we live by. I have spent many late nights discussing the mysteries of life with good friends.

To further pursue my interests outside of class and expand my skill set I have been involved with Ethics Bowl and Model United Nations. In Ethics Bowl my team and I take up nuanced positions on important ethical dilemmas and articulate our position in competitions. Model United Nations allows me to learn about a nation's policies and perspectives, then at conferences solve global problems with the collaboration of representatives from other nations. 

In my life, I bring the different perspectives of computer science and philosophy together to examine the world and solve problems in new and unique ways.
